        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Pulled pork is a classic dish typically made from slow-cooked 
                pork shoulder that is seasoned and cooked until tender, 
                allowing the meat to be easily shredded or "pulled" apart. 
                It's often seasoned with a blend of spices, marinated, 
                and cooked with barbecue sauce or a vinegar-based sauce, 
                depending on regional styles. The dish is commonly served on a bun 
                as a sandwich, paired with coleslaw, or as part of a platter 
                with sides like cornbread and baked beans. The result is a flavorful, 
                juicy meat that melts in your mouth, offering a rich, smoky, 
                and savory experience.
